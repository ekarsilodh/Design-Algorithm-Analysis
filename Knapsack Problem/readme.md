The program takes the inputs from a file. The input file should be .txt file. The 1st line will contain the number of vertices in the graph. Then each line will contain the edge properties i.e. the source,destination and path length.

An example of the .txt file for the problem:

Consider the following knapsack problem where n = 7, W = 15 Kgs, (v1, v2, v3, v4, v5, v6, v7) = (10, 5, 15, 7, 6, 18, 3), and (w1, w2, w3, w4, w5, w6, w7) = (2, 3, 5, 7, 1, 4, 1).

7

15

1 2 10

2 3 5

3 5 15

4 7 7

5 1 6

6 4 18

7 1 3

where the 1st line is no. of items, 2nd is the weight of the knapsack & then followed by item id, its weight and value.
